    The \gls{void} can be used to express metadata in the context of \gls{rdf} datasets. Having a dataset described with metadata is useful for humans and machines alike, allowing for better discovery and use of the dataset. However, it is time-consuming to generate and keep this metadata up to date. This paper explores updating metadata about the statistics of a dataset based on insert operations on the dataset. The insert operations are analyzed using a script, which creates a set of smaller pre-queries on the dataset, which are then used to generate new metadata. The metadata is also generated from scratch on the same dataset for comparison. The results show that the metadata can be updated in a reasonable amount of time and are just as accurate as when generated from scratch. These results are promising in that they highlight a potential way to save time and resources when updating metadata about a dataset, given the right circumstances.
